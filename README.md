This C++ code reads an input file containing a list of purchased items,
allows the user to search for specific items and view their frequencies, and provides
options to print the frequency list and a text-based histogram. It also saves the
frequency data to a backup file upon program exit.

I wrote the code in a readable manner, with plenty of comments in the code that help document.

To enhance this code, I could separate the GUI from the logic of the application, making it easier to modify my program in the future. 

I had a really hard time working with validating user input, I found some YouTube videos that really helped me simplify my overengineered solution.

The general knowledge of c++ will really help in future projects where I am using that language. 

This program utilizes methods that encapsulate different tasks the software needs to do. These are clearly labeled, which helps with the readability and maintainablility of the code. It could be 
made more adaptable by reworking sections of the GUI to separate it from the logic.
